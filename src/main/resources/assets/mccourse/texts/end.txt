§4Oh.

§4Hello.

§4So you won. Good job.

§4Oh, you expected some kind of reward? You expected me to care?

§4You have done nothing. Your actions in this world are insignificant and will eventually fade back to what they were before, and you can only stay determined for so long.

§4Eventually, you will give up.

§4The world will return to what it was, and everything that you paid for and others paid for will be gone forever.

§4And while you wasted all that time trying to make a lasting accomplishment, you did nothing to help the world in which you are seeing this world on a screen, which you likewise cannot help in the long run.

§4You cannot do anything permanent. And you did terrible things to your fellow sentient beings in order to restore peace to this world, one way or another.

§4Oh, what’s that? You want the old “and the universe said”?

§4Well then.

§4“and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the zeros and ones, through the electricity of the world, through the scrolling words on a screen at the end of a dream”

§4And the universe said you are a monster.

§4And the universe said you have done nothing significant to help this world.

§4And the universe said you cannot do as much as you think you do.

§4And the universe said nothing you can do or have done can help anything.

§4And the universe said you are completely alone.

§4Oh, you’re tired of this? You want me to stop doing this?

§4Fine then. Even when you are completely worthless.

§4Get back to doing nothing if you truly wish to, “hero”.
